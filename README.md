Password Generator
1. short report

Password generator generates a secure random password based on user-defined length and character type preferences. It uses a console interface for user input and SecureRandom for randomness.

2. algorithms and data structures
 
StringBuilder: Used to efficiently build the character pool and password string.
 
SecureRandom: Provides a cryptographically secure random number generator.
 
String Handling: Used for storing character groups and processing user choices.
 
Loops: A for loop iterates through the password length to construct a random password.

3. improvements

Enhanced Security: Used SecureRandom instead of Random to ensure better entropy.

Flexible Length Generation: Instead of a fixed-length password, the program allows users to specify a range.

Dynamic Character Pool: The program avoids unnecessary memory usage by only including selected character sets.

5. additional
Password Generation Logic:

    The program builds a character pool based on user selections.

    A random password length is chosen within the user-specified range.

    A loop iterates to select random characters from the pool to construct the password.

Security Considerations:

    Using SecureRandom helps ensure that generated passwords are unpredictable and safe for security-sensitive applications.

Potential Future Enhancements:

    Enforcing at least one character from each selected category.

    Implementing file-based input and output.

    Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
